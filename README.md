# SinclairScientific

This is a recreation of the Sinclair Scientific calculator, which was introduced in 1974 as the first affordable scientific calculator.

## Inspiration

This work was inspired by and largely based upon [ArduinoEnigma's similar project](https://gitlab.com/arduinoenigma/ArduinoNanoSinclairScientificCalculator), which was inspired by [Ken Shirriff's Sinclair Scientific Calculator Simulator](http://righto.com/sinclair). The hardware design is based upon [Adafruit's Feather M0](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Feather-M0-Basic-Proto-PCB), as well as [ArduinoEnigma's hardware designs](https://hackaday.io/project/91895-sinclair-scientific-calculator-emulator). The firmware used in this project is based on [ArduinoEnigma's SinclairScientific7 code](https://gitlab.com/arduinoenigma/ArduinoNanoSinclairScientificCalculator/tree/master/SinclairScientific7) and [Adafruit's SAMD toolchain](https://github.com/adafruit/ArduinoCore-samd).

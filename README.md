# SinclairScientific

This is a recreation of the Sinclair Scientific calculator, which was introduced in 1974 as the first affordable scientific calculator. 

This work was inspired by and laregely based upon [ArduinoEnigma's similar project](https://gitlab.com/arduinoenigma/ArduinoNanoSinclairScientificCalculator), which in turn was inspired by Ken Shirriff's [Sinclair Scientific Calculator Simulator](http://righto.com/sinclair). The firmware code used in this project is based on ArduinoEnigma's [SinclairScientific7 code](https://gitlab.com/arduinoenigma/ArduinoNanoSinclairScientificCalculator/tree/master/SinclairScientific7).
